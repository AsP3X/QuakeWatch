### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: Docker containers
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring
- **Hosting**: Vercel (website), Cloud platforms (scraper)

## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Scraper fetches GeoJSON from EMSC-CSEM API
2. **Data Processing**: Raw data is validated and cleaned
3. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in database
4. **Data Access**: Web application retrieves data via API
5. **Data Display**: Frontend renders data with interactive maps

## Quality Assurance

### Data Quality
- Schema validation for incoming data
- Data completeness checks
- Geographical coordinate validation
- Duplicate detection and handling

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Unit and integration tests
- Code review process

### Performance
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
- API response optimization
- Frontend performance monitoring

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes**: Implement versioning and fallback mechanisms
- **Data Quality Issues**: Robust validation and error handling
- **Performance Issues**: Monitoring and optimization strategies

### Operational Risks
- **Data Loss**: Regular backups and recovery procedures
- **Service Downtime**: Health checks and alerting
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Data collection success rate > 95%
- API response time < 500ms
- Database query performance
- System uptime > 99%

### User Experience Metrics

## Project Organization

This master plan provides a high-level overview of the QuakeWatch system. The project has been organized into separate, detailed planning documents for better maintainability and focused development:

### Planning Documents
- **[Master Plan](./planning.md)** - This document with system overview
- **[Data Scraper Plan](./scraper-plan.md)** - Complete scraper implementation details
- **[Website Plan](./website-plan.md)** - Complete web application implementation details
- **[Database Plan](./database-plan.md)** - Complete database structure and schema design
- **[Color Pattern Design](./color-pattern-design.md)** - Design system and visual guidelines

### Development Approach
Each component can be developed independently following its respective detailed plan, while maintaining integration through the shared database layer. This modular approach allows for:

- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on scraper and website simultaneously
- **Focused Planning**: Each plan contains component-specific details and timelines
- **Easy Maintenance**: Updates and changes can be made to individual components
- **Clear Documentation**: Each plan serves as comprehensive documentation for its component

## Conclusion

The QuakeWatch system provides a comprehensive solution for fault data management through a robust data scraper and modern web application. The modular architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and excellent user experience.

The detailed planning documents provide clear roadmaps for implementation, while this master plan maintains the overall system perspective and integration points.
